Next steps would depend on the specific requirements of your school management application.However, some suggestions could be:

Implement user registration: Create a registration form and route to allow new users to create an account.

Implement user roles and permissions: Define different roles for users (e.g.student, teacher, admin) and restrict access to certain parts of the application based on those roles.

Implement password reset functionality: Allow users to reset their password if they forget it.

Implement user profile editing: Allow users to edit their profile information (e.g.name, email, phone number).

Implement CRUD functionality for other models: Depending on the requirements of your application, you may need to create additional models (e.g.classes, assignments, grades) and implement CRUD functionality for them.

Implement data visualization: Create charts and graphs to display data in a more user-friendly way.

Implement email notifications: Send email notifications to users for important events (e.g.new assignments, upcoming exams).

Implement search functionality: Allow users to search for specific information within the application.

Implement API endpoints: Create API endpoints to allow other applications to access and interact with your application's data.

These are just a few suggestions, but the next steps will ultimately depend on the specific requirements of your application.
